    "- `experience`: character variable, 5 categories (\"Pro\", \"Veteran\", \"Amateur\", \"Regular\", \"Beginner\") based on how much experience the player has with Minecraft.\n",
    "- `subscribe`: logical variable, returns \"TRUE\" or \"FALSE\" depending if the player is currently subscribed to a game-related newsletter\n",
    "- `hashedEmail`: character variable returning the player's email, irreversibly transformed to a unique string (facilitating individualization while retaining privacy).\n",
    "- `played_hours`: double-class variable corresponding to how many hours the player has spent playing the game.\n",
    "- `name`: character variable containing the player's name (likely first name).\n",
    "- `gender`: character variable, 7 categories (\"Male\", \"Female\", \"Non-binary\", \"Prefer not to say\", \"Agender\", \"Two-Spirited\", \"Other\"), self-reported by the player.\n",
    "- `Age`: double-class variable returning the player's age in years (self-reported).\n",
    "\n",
    "While summary statistics can be individually computed with commands like `mean()`, `min()`, or `max()`, in this case it is efficient to collect them all at once with `summary()`. There are three different variables in `players_data` for which summary statistics can be calculated (barring general statistics like `length`, `class`, and `mode`). Summary statistics have been rounded to two decimal places.\n",

    "There are no apparent issues in the data. There could be issues that I cannot see, for example in the `hashedEmail` variable. Values within variables (perhaps `name` and `hashedEmail`) could be mismatched, and I cannot see the \"real\" email name to infer if the values are assigned properly.\n",

    "The `players_data` data was collected by the Pacific Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence (PLAI) research group in the Department of Computer Science at UBC. PLAI has created PLAICraft (a vanilla survival Minecraft server) to record participant players' gameplay, speech, and key presses to advance AI, hopefully to assist NPC development in \"normal\" Minecraft.\n",
